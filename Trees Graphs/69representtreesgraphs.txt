1. In cp mostly the vertices are 1 based. 
2. Most of the question are done by DFS 
3. You can also use the vector of vector as an alternative.

Adjacency Matrix
----------------------
O(N^2) space complexity(disadvantage)
N<=10^3
N!=10^5

Adjacency List
-------------------
O(Vertices+Edges) space complexity
N is number of vertices
N=10^5,E<=10^7
//approx number of edges are vertex^2


//check if i,j connected ?
//check for weights of i,j =?

-->in Matrix
if(graph1[i][j])
{
    //connected
    //O(1)  (This is advantage of Adjacency Matrix)
}


-->in List
for(int child: graph2[i])
{
    if(child==j)
    //connected
    //O(N)   (This is the dis-advantage of Adjacency List)
}



..matrix with be (vertices X vertices)
..matrix[i][j]=1 will say that vertex i,j is connected
