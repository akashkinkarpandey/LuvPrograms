.vertex may or may not be connected by edge in graph
.tree is bidirectional or undirected graph with no cycle
.tree has n-1 edges for n nodes
.graph may have many components not connected to each other
.bidirectional graphs are undirected
.unidirectional graphs are directed
.graphs with no cycle is acyclic
.strongly connected components are components in which we can always go 
  from one vertex to another vertex
.full graph is forest
.LCA IS LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR
